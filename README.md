## Overview

This project implements a full end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline. It trains a **Logistic Regression** model on the Palmer Penguins dataset and serves it via a user-friendly web interface.

Users can input physical measurements (bill length, flipper length, etc.) to get a real-time prediction of the penguin species (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, or *Gentoo*). All predictions are saved locally for historical analysis.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Plotly Dash and Bootstrap components.
* **Real-time Inference:** Immediate classification results with probability scores.
* **Data Persistence:** User predictions are saved to `data/processed/` and visualized alongside historical data.
* **Containerized:** Fully Dockerized for "write once, run anywhere" deployment.
* **Robust Pipeline:** Automated data cleaning, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

## Prerequisites

To run the application in the recommended mode, you only need:

* **Docker Desktop** (running)

*Note: No Python installation is required on your local machine if you use the provided scripts.*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

Pprovided are automated scripts to build and run the application in a container.

### For Windows Users
1.  Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2.  Double-click the file **`start_app_windows.bat`**.
3.  A console window will open, build the image, and automatically launch your default browser at `http://localhost:8050`.

### For Mac / Linux Users
1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the project folder.
3.  Make the script executable (only needed once):
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_app_linux.sh
    ```
4.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./start_app_linux.sh
    ```

**Stopping the App:**
Simply close the terminal window or press `CTRL + C`. The container will automatically shut down and clean up.

---

## Local Development

If you wish to develop or run the code without Docker, you need **Python 3.10+** and **Poetry** (or pip).

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
    *Or using Poetry:*
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2.  **Train the Model:**
    If you want to retrain the model with new parameters:
    ```bash
    python -m src.penguin_classifier.modeling.train
    ```
    This updates `models/pipeline.joblib` and `reports/metrics.json`.

3.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.penguin_classifier.app
    ```

---

## Model Information

The classification model is a **Logistic Regression** pipeline optimized via 5-fold Cross-Validation.

* **Preprocessing:**
    * *Numerical Features:* Scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    * *Categorical Features:* Encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
* **Performance:**
    * Metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall) are automatically tracked in `reports/metrics.json` after every training run.
    * Current Test Accuracy: **>98%** (depending on the random seed).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Port 8050 is already in use"**
* **Cause:** Another instance of the app is already running.
* **Solution:** Close any open terminal windows running the app or run `docker stop $(docker ps -q)` to kill all containers.

**Problem: Docker script closes immediately**
* **Solution:** Open Docker Desktop and ensure the engine is running.
